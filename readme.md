# Slack Black Theme - Deprecated

As of Slack v4+, this theme no longer installs correctly, and some
alternatives provided by the community are robust and well-maintained.

On my MacBook, the theme I'm using is
[https://github.com/elv1n/slack-dark-mojave-theme/blob/master/README.md#slack-dark-mojave-theme]()

There is discussion, including alternatives
that may work for other platforms, at
